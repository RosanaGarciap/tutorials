<font size="4">Hi dear reader, and welcome to Introduction to Data Structures! </font>

First of all, thank you for your interest in our **Data Structures Tutorial** in this course you will find easy explinations for three of the most used data structures: Queue, Linked List, and Trees. Be aware that our course will not contain all types of modern functionalities and representations of these structures, the goal is help you to obtain the basic knowledge required for you to understand how datastructures work and how they can be applied to model real life events.

# Introduction to Data Structures Concepts
## What is a Data Structure? 🧱

The first concept you need to understand is the concept of Data Structure, the definition can be easily guessed by the words that compose it Data and Structure.

Data, is a value. Yes, as simple as it sounds, data is just a value that have not meaning by it self. Think of data as a brick of legos, in programming data values can be classified according to it's type (block colors), it can ba a basic type such as Integer, Float, and Char or more complex types like String and Null.

A data by it self has no special meaning just like a brick doesn't look special by itself, however, when provided the data is grouped and manipulated it allows people to gain information of different aspect of lifes. As when you unite blocks to built a castle or an car, if you have the number **2** it says nothing to you, but if you have the expression **2+2=4** Now that you understand that the sum of 2 with itself is equals to 4, even more, with more data of the same kind we can infere the sum of any numeric value with itself is equals to two times its original value.

Now that you understand what is Data pounder about the next question. What kind of information can I get if instead of a data alone I have a set of diferent kinds of datas oranized, and that's were the word structure take place.

A data structure is a set of data elements organized following a formal model for an abstract but logical representation, like the car made of legos it is not a real car but an abstract representation of it. That means the data can organized together as a whole and this whole is built specifically to repesent in an abstract way the behavior or characteristic of something on the real world, the logic of the type of data that will be used, along with the operations that can be applied over them, facilitate the effective use and manipulation of data.

### Common Data Structures
In progrmming world exist a set of data structures which attributes and the operations that can be made over them are already defined at international level. In this course we will study 3 of them:

1. Queue
2. Linked List
3. Tree
